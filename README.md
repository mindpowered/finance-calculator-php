```
{
        "require": {
                "mindpowered/financecalculator" : "*"
        }

```
Now you can run the command to update composer: `composer update`. In order for composer to install the package dependencies you will need an archive manager such as zip installed. Composer requires use of the commands `zip` and `unzip`.
